# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves both visual and statistical techniques to scrutinize data, revealing underlying patterns, trends, and insights. By employing EDA, analysts can gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristic,feature selection,Feature engineering, and decision-making processes.

# Algorithms Steps

# 1. Data Collection: 
Obtain the dataset(s) to be analyzed from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or files.

# 2. Data Cleaning:
1) Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data points.
2) Handle outliers: Identify and address outliers that deviate significantly from the rest of the data.
3) Standardize data types: Ensure consistency in data types across variables.

# 3. Data Exploration 
1) Summary statistics: Compute descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the central tendency and variability of numerical variables.
2) Visualization: Generate visual representations of the data using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to explore distributions, relationships, and patterns.
3) Univariate analysis: Analyze individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.
4) Bivariate analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations or associations.
5) Multivariate analysis: Examine interactions among multiple variables to gain deeper insights.

# 4. Feature Engineering:
# Create new features: 
Derive additional variables from existing ones to capture relevant information.
# Transform variables: 
Apply transformations (e.g., log transformation) to improve the distribution of variables.
# Feature scaling: 
Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.

# 5. Reporting and Documentation:
# Document the EDA process: 
Record the steps taken, techniques used, and findings obtained during the exploratory analysis.
# Share conclusions: 
Communicate conclusions, recommendations, and actionable insights to stakeholders or decision-makers.
# Visualize results: 
Present visualizations and summary statistics in reports or presentations to communicate insights effectively.

# 6. Interpretation:
# Identify key findings:
Summarize important observations, patterns, and relationships discovered during the analysis.
# Formulate hypotheses: 
Generate hypotheses or conjectures based on the insights gained from the data.
# Validate assumptions:
Assess the validity of assumptions made during the analysis process.
